TODO extra: implement mode-switching controller, use that instead of either BangBang or PID controllers in the main function

Q: how to implement frequency?
Frequency is the realtime delta between controller read/write iterations; the clock number in the info line is irrelevant

TCL spec requirements:
-thermal control using PID (or bangbang controller)
-let user adjust Kp Ki Kd before execution
-let user define setpoint for each controller, with 0 as default
 .at runtime, let user adjust the setpoint between -20 and 20, for each or all controllers
-let user enable/disable thermal control
 .upon being enabled, TCL should start reading temperature values from TSL and feed the TSL with heater power status according
 to the controller(s) output
 .upon being disabled, TCL should stop reading values from TSL, and turn off all heater power
-at start, TCF shall acquire the power status of heaters 1 through 4
-at every 5Hz, TCF shall acquire values of thermistors 1 through 4
 .let user update frequency at runtime, between 1Hz and 5Hz
-TCF shall operate heaters via TSL-provided interface based on the output from the PID controller
 .shall operate heater power status, to mantain the temperature of each thermistor at the nominal value of 0 degrees Celsius
